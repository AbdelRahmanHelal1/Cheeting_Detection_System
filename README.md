# 🎓 Cheating Detection System in Exams using YOLOv8 Pose Estimation

This project uses **YOLOv8 pose estimation** to detect possible **cheating behaviors** during exams by analyzing body and head movements of students. It monitors human posture, gaze direction, and detects suspicious patterns such as side glances, leaning, or signaling.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Loads a lightweight YOLOv8-pose model (`yolov8n-pose.pt`)
- Processes each video frame to:
  - Detect persons
  - Extract keypoints (head, shoulders, etc.)
  - Analyze head position relative to shoulders
- Draws **red box** if student is frequently turning head sideways
